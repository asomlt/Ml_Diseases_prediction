# Disease Prediction Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Disease Prediction Machine Learning Project! This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a certain disease based on various features using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

In this project, we have developed a machine learning model that takes into account several input features such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle factors to predict the probability of a person having a specific disease. The model has been trained on a labeled dataset containing historical data of patients, including both positive and negative cases of the disease.

## Dependencies

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Before running the model, make sure to prepare your data in a CSV format with appropriate columns representing the input features and the target variable (disease label).

2. **Training the Model**: To train the model, run the `train_model.py` script by providing the path to your training dataset as a command-line argument. For example:

    ```bash
    python train_model.py --data_path data/training_data.csv
    ```

    This will train the model on the specified dataset and save the trained model to a file (`model.pkl` by default).

3. **Making Predictions**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data. Modify the `predict.py` script to load your trained model and provide input data for prediction.

    ```python
    # Load the trained model
    model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

    # Provide input data for prediction
    input_data = {
        'age': 35,
        'gender': 'Male',
        # Add other input features here
    }

    # Make predictions
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    ```

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can modify the `evaluate_model.py` script to load your trained model and evaluate it on a separate test dataset.
